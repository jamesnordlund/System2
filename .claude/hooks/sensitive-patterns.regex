# Sensitive File Protector - Additional Patterns File
# ====================================================
#
# This file contains ADDITIONAL regex patterns for files that should be
# blocked from Read, Edit, Write, and Bash operations.
#
# These patterns are used IN ADDITION to the built-in default patterns
# which protect common credential files like .env, ~/.ssh/*, ~/.aws/*, etc.
#
# FORMAT:
# - One regex pattern per line
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Empty lines are ignored
# - Patterns are combined with OR (any match = block)
# - Patterns are matched against normalized file paths
# - Use (^|/) prefix to match at start or after directory separator
# - Use (?i) for case-insensitive matching
#
# USAGE:
# Pass this file as an argument to the sensitive-file-protector.py hook:
#   python3 ./scripts/claude-hooks/sensitive-file-protector.py .claude/hooks/sensitive-patterns.regex
#
