# Dangerous Command Blocker - Allowlist File
# ============================================
#
# This file contains regex patterns for commands that should be ALLOWED
# even if they match the built-in dangerous command patterns.
#
# FORMAT:
# - One regex pattern per line
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Empty lines are ignored
# - Patterns are combined with OR (any match = allow)
# - Patterns are matched against the FULL command string
# - Use ^ and $ anchors for exact matches
#
# USAGE:
# Pass this file as an argument to the dangerous-command-blocker.py hook:
#   python3 ./scripts/claude-hooks/dangerous-command-blocker.py .claude/hooks/dangerous-commands-allowlist.regex
#
# WARNING:
# Adding patterns to this allowlist bypasses safety checks. Only add
# patterns for commands you fully understand and trust.
